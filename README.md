# To-do list

To-do lists don't need to be complicatedâ€”plenty of people use a pen and paper for the job without any problem.
One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. 
When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When you've got a clear outline of the tasks you've got to do 
and those you've completed, it helps you stay focused.
